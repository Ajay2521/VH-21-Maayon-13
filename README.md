## Problem Statement : 
 Solving the problem of traditional land registry system and making land registry system in blockchain in which the record will be digitalized and stored permanently for whenever needed.

### Abstract : 

 Traditional land registry system need lot of paper works and human interaction in which the data can be lost or mis-entred and there is lot of chance for the data to be changed by the unauthorised persons thus our proposed system will ensure all the records and transaction which is happening in the land registry system will be recorded and data will be stored in the blockchain network permanently once the data stored in the blockchain then there is no way to change tha data value thus it provide a huge support to tamper proof data. The records or transaction in the Blockchain network can be verified by the hash value which is generated at the every instance of time thus accountability of the data will be ensured. Only authorised user will able to make a transaction only if the user satifics the condition of the smart contract.
